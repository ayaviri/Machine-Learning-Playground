what do i want this program to accomplish ?
given the training data, i want to come up with a 
linear model. this requires an slope and a y intercept, 
m and b values respectively. i also want to calculate the 
error of this linear model on the training data. with this 
calculated linear model, i then want to apply it to the 
test data and calculate the error. i also want visualizations
of both the training data and the test data with and without the linear model

wishlist: 
- visualizations: 
    - training data:
        - with model
        - without model
    - test data: 
        - with model
        - without model
- models:
    - linear equation (slope and y-intercept)
- statistical measures: 
    - error: of linear model on test data
